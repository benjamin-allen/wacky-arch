    "StartingComments": "So the ROM for the O-77 that we dug up is pretty corrupted. It has all sorts of segments and we need your help to get them reimplemented.\n\nWe need a BCD-to-binary converter. Normally this would be done in hardware, but of course no hardware BCD support.\n\nBCD values from 0 to 200 arrive from the top. Convert them to binary and write them to the output.\nImplement the converter as an infinite loop.",
