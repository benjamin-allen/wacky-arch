    "Name": "ROM Repair - Reversi",
    "Description": "A portion of the ROM is broken and needs to be rewritten. We just don't know how to do it.",
    "StartingComments": "This was a portion of the ROM that took 5 inputs from the TOP pipe and wrote them in reverse order. Given that there are only 4 registers, we're not sure how that was done.\n\nWhatever solution you come up with, implement it as an infinite loop that read numbers 5-at-a-time, reverses them.",
