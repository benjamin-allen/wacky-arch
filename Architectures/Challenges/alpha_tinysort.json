    "Description": "A portion of the ROM is broken and needs to be rewritten. Sorting is fun when you only have 4 registers!",
    "StartingComments": "One corrupted portion of the ROM merged two streams of input from TOP and BOTTOM and sorted them.\n\nNumbers arrive in pairs from TOP and a single one from BOTTOM, for 3 numbers total. Sort them in ascending order and write them to OUTPUT.\n\nImplement this as an infinite loop that does this continuously.",

    "BottomInputData": [ 4, 48, -4 ],
