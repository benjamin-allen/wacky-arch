    "Description": "A portion of the ROM is broken and needs to be rewritten. We know some of its inputs and outputs but not much else.",
    "StartingComments": "A portion of the ROM has been corrupted; you'll need to deduce the function and implement it. The function only needs a single word, which gets fed in from TOP.\n\nf(1) = f(2) = f(4) = f(8) = ... = 1\nf(3) = f(5) = 2\nf(46) = f(673) = 3\nf(-1) = 12\nImplement it as an infinite loop.",
